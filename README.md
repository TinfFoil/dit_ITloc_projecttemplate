## Description of the project

This project contains the templates for the software localisation final project submission. 

The project consists of a number of files and folders that should be downloaded, filled, and submitted. 

Regarding submission, as of today (March 23rd, 2020), I am exploring whether to use Moodle, email, or github itself. 
Those students who opt for forking the repo and version-control it here, are welcome to invite me to your project to 
keep track of the development.
