## Overview

This project contains the templates for the software localisation 
final project submission. 

The project consists of a number of files and folders that should 
be downloaded, filled, and submitted. 

Regarding submission, as of today (March 23rd, 2020), I am 
exploring whether to use Moodle, email, or github itself. 

Those students who opt for forking the repo and version-control 
it here, are welcome to invite me to your project to keep track of 
the development. 

## Files and Folders

### Values folder

An empty folder with name "values". You should add your 
localisation files here. I expect only XML files.  Do not add any 
additional characters to the file names. For instance, use 
**strings.xml**, not strings_myteam.xml. Do not create any 
subfolder.

(I know the name of the folder should be values-ll, where ll is 
es, fr, or it; do not worry about this.)

### Additional materials folder

In order to produce a high-quality localisation, you might need to 
create some additional resources. These include translation 
memories and glossaries. If you have created any of these, feel 
free to put them in folder **additional_materials** (and do not 
forget to describe them in your written report).

### Written Report

File written_report.txt contains a template on the report you should 
submit, along with the localisation files and (potential) additional 
material. This is **just a template**, including the minimal reasonable 
sections and corresponding contents. Feel free to add extra contents 
as necessary. Think of this as a report you would send to your 
employer/client when submitting your localisation (+ some extra 
details for me to evaluate you)

You can submit your written report in three alternative formats:

- A plain-text txt file 
- A machine-readable pdf file (not protected)
- An html file

No other format will be accepted. If you use Latex, LibreOffice, 
MS Word, or any other language/software, produce any of these 
formats.

Unless you are adding figures or require some special formatting, 
a txt file could be enough.

### Academic Integrity

File academic_integrity.txt is a plain-text file which contains a student 
certification. You should open it and fill the necessary information,
which you will find surrounded by square brackets. For instance, if you see 

I [WRITE YOUR NAME], declare...

and your name is John Smith, you should write 

I John Smith, declare...
