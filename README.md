## Description of the project

This project contains the templates for the software localisation final project submission. 

The project consists of a number of files and folders that should be downloaded, filled, and submitted. 

Regarding submission, as of today (March 23rd, 2020), I am exploring whether to use Moodle, email, or github itself. 
Those students who opt for forking the repo and version-control it here, are welcome to invite me to your project to 
keep track of the development. 

## Files and Folders

### Values folder

An empty folder with name "values". You should add your localisation files here. I expect only XML files. 

### Academic Integrity

File academic_integrity.txt is a plain-text file which contains a student certification. You should open it and fill the necessary information, which you will find surrounded by square brackets. For instance, if you see 

I [WRITE YOUR NAME], declare...

and your name is John Smith, you should write 

I John Smith, declare...

Thsi file is derived from Columbia's Law School [certifications](https://www.law.columbia.edu/academic-rules/certifications-academic-integrity#written-work)
