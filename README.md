## Overview

This project contains the templates for the software localisation final project submission. 

The project consists of a number of files and folders that should be downloaded, filled, and submitted. 

Regarding submission, as of today (March 23rd, 2020), I am exploring whether to use Moodle, email, or github itself. 
Those students who opt for forking the repo and version-control it here, are welcome to invite me to your project to 
keep track of the development. 

## Files and Folders

### Values folder

An empty folder with name "values". You should add your localisation files here. I expect only XML files.  Do not add any additional characters to the file names. For instance, use **strings.xml**, not strings_myteam.xml. Do not create any subfolder.

(I know the name of the folder should be values-ll, where ll is es, fr, or it; do not worry about this)

### Additional materials folder

In order to produce a high-quality localisation, you might need to create some additional resources. 
These include translation memories and glossaries. If you have created any of these, feel free to put them in folder **additional_materials** (and do not forget to describe them in your written report).

### Written Report

File written_report.txt contains a template on the report you should submit, along with the localisation files and 
(potential) additional material. This is just a template, including the minimal reasonable sections. You can add 
additional contents at will.

You can submit your written report in three alternative formats:

- A a plain-text txt file 
- A pdf file, produced with Latex, LibreOffice, MS Word, or any other software
- An html file

Unless you are adding figures or require some special formatting, a txt file should be enough.

### Academic Integrity

File academic_integrity.txt is a plain-text file which contains a student certification. You should open it and fill the necessary information, which you will find surrounded by square brackets. For instance, if you see 

I [WRITE YOUR NAME], declare...

and your name is John Smith, you should write 

I John Smith, declare...

Thsi file is derived from Columbia's Law School [certifications](https://www.law.columbia.edu/academic-rules/certifications-academic-integrity#written-work)
