# FAQ for IT Loc 2023 Final Project and Evaluation

This FAQ contains all kind of questions regarding the evaluation process for the 
IT Localization 2023 course. If an aspect is missing or is not properly 
addressed here, do not hesitate to get in touch.

I divide the FAQ in a number of topics. 

## The oral discussion

### Q. Who takes part in the oral discussion?

The two team members and the instructor.

### Q. What kind of questions are going to be asked?

The oral session tries to partially _mimic_ the discussion between the 
localization team (you) and the client that requested the project (me).

Expect questions asking you to justify your actions, decisions, or lack of them. 
Expect also questions which purpose is to fill any gap observed in your report 
or localization files.

## The written report

### What are the expected contents for the report?

A template was created for you containing the minimal contents. It includes a 
number of sections and suggested contents. You are free to add extra sections 
and contents as you consider necessary.

Remember that those minimal contents involve a mix: 
(a) the report you would handle to the client when delivering the localisation 
and 
(b) information relevant for the class evaluation. 

### What is the expected length for the report?

There is no expected length. You are free to write as much as necessary. 

**Note** A longer report is _not_ a better report. I am not going to evaluate 
the amount of time spent on the keyboard. I am going to evaluate the quality of 
your work and how it reflects your knowledge. 


## The submission 

### What happens if my submitted files are broken?

I suggest to submit them long before the deadline (e.g., at least one week in 
advance). If I find that your file(s) is broken, I will notify you and you will 
have some time to amend it ---always before the deadline. 

**Note** This should be _exceptional_. I am happy to give you the chance to 
amend your submission, but (a) I expect to have to do it only for a handful of 
cases and (b) for such handful of cases I expect to do it once. 

## The final score

### Q. What is the percentage given to the submitted work and the oral discussion?

There is no percentage. Both activities are considered as part of one holistic 
project.

### Q. How is the score for each student defined, within the team?

Both members of the team will receive the same score. Once again: it is one 
whole project being evaluated. Hence: 
(a) get sure your workload is fair, 
(b) get sure you are both aware of and happy with all decisions and features, and
(c) come prepared to the oral discussion (e.g., avoid answers of the kind "I was 
not in charge of that").

## Opting for the second call

### Q: Can I opt for skipping this call and go for the second call?

Of course!

### Q: Can I jump to the second call with the same project?

The current project is valid for both dates of the so-called 1st appello (most likely 
in June). If you are planning to take part of the appello in September, that involves
working on a different project.

### Q: Can I go to the second call alone?

No. The same rules as for the first call apply to the second call. As soon as 
there is at least one more person presenting the exam, you will compose a team.
